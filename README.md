### About me

![Picture of me](/images/me.JPG){width=200px}

Hello! My name is Arohee (pronounced AH-roh-hee), I use any pronouns, and I am a self- and community-taught handpoke tattoo artist based in Pittsburgh, PA. Much of my work is whimsical and abstract, inspired by natural forms and vintage ornament. I have always found tattooing to be a form of liberation -- a reclamation of one's body and the way it is perceived, and a commitment to honoring one's own authentic self in a society that expects assimilation and privileges invisibility.

I came to tattooing in late 2025 as part of a journey to reconnect with my creativity, and I am immensely grateful for the kindness, generosity, and trust I have received from the community in such a short time.

### How to book

My books are always open for flash or custom pieces! 

For booking flash: DM me on Instagram with the piece you're interested in and size/placement info, and we'll get something scheduled. I'm more than happy to modify or collage flash, both beforehand or on the day of your appointment. You are always allowed to change your mind about design, size, and/or placement, no worries!

For booking custom: same thing except describe your vision -- you can be as general or specific as you want! I generally do not send custom designs in advance, but we will have plenty of time to make changes during your appointment until you're completely happy with the piece. 

### Housekeeping

Location: I work out of my home studio in Shadyside -- I will provide the address and further details after confirming your appointment. I am located near a stop on the East Busway, and I am also very accessible via local bus lines :) My space is pretty small, so please let me know beforehand if you would like to bring a guest.

Late policy: Life happens, I totally understand! But please give me a heads up if you know you will be more than ten minutes late, and if you're running more than half an hour late we may have to reschedule your appointment. 

Trades: I love doing trades with other local artists and makers!! All I ask is that it's an ~even exchange of time and resources. If you're interested in trading with me, reach out and we can make something happen!

Tipping: Tips are very appreciated but not at all expected. I also love non-monetary tips!

Touch-ups: Always free! Reach out after your tattoo is healed and we'll set something up.

### Pricing

Beginning February 2026: most of my flash is around $50-150 depending on size and complexity. I am more than happy to work with your budget or provide a price quote. I also offer discounts for multiple pieces in one session!
